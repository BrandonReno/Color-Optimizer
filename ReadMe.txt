Everything is set up with the WeightsWrite File, Genetic takes in Weights Write and runs a genetic algorithm on it then tests the weights on the NN again at the end. 
All parameters that are controlable are in the top of genetic and the top of Neurons. Have Genetic running just one generation now but more could be added if wanted.
Genetic works just as a genetic alogrithim does except the fitness is the percent correct given from the neural network.
